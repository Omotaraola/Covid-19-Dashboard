- To analyze the top 5 countries with the highest death rate from 2020 till 2022.
- To analyze top 5 countries that recovered from the corona-virus from 2020 till 2022.

## Data Sourcing
Data was scraped from the web (COVID19/GitHub) into MSExcel, as this will enable a real-time update.

## Data Preparation
- Analysis was done using power query editor.
- Dashboard Visualization was created using Pivot Table.

## Data Transformation
A three time series data tables was scrapped from github. These tables were merged on power query to create one consolidated data table. New columns (month, year and day) were created, to match the real time data.
